# Hyperplane-based-LSH-for-ANN
This is my final project of ANN search algorithm for Data Structures & Algorithms course in the last semester.  

I chose the local sensitive hash algorithm and got 93 points when playing the leaderboard online.        

The code was written in C++. To quickly get a decent scores, my code was designed roughly and was process-oriented. Maybe I 'll update someday. 

To understand the LSH, you can refer to my tech report as well as the material listed below.  \
